*History*:
/************************  About CCASat *******************************/    
      
CCASat is a local search solver for the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem.
CCASat is designed and implemented by Shaowei Cai, when he was pursuing his Phd degree in Peking University (Beijing, China, 2012).  
This is a tidy version that performs (almost) the same as the one submitted to SAT Challenge 2012.
The binary and codes of CCASat are permitted to be used for education and research purposes.
