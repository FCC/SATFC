/**
 * <p>
 * Reads a text file that represents a simple graph, where each line in the file represents an edge
 *  between two nodes, and each node is designated by an integer. Nodes are separated by a space.
 *  Nodes are interpreted to represent stations; each numerical node is used to construct a Station,
 *  where Stations are defined completely by a single integer. Lines starting with '//' are interpreted
 *  as comments. Blank lines are also ignored.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Note that in certain situations, one station needs to be designated as a starting point in a search.
 *     For such cases, node number 0 is reserved to represent this node.

 * <p> Example contents of a simple graph file:
 *  <pre>
 *  // The first line of this graph file is commented out.
 *  1 0
 *  3
 *
 *  1 2
 * </pre></p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     This example graph file represents a graph consisting of stations 0, 1, 2, and 3, with edges between
 *     stations 1 and 0, and between stations 1 and 2. Station 3 is not connected to any other station.
