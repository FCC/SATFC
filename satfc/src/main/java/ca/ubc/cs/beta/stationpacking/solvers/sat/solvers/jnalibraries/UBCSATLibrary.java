 * This is the Java half of the JNA bridge used to run any legal configuration of UBCSAT/SATenstein from SATFC.
 *
 * ***WARNING***: Due to conventions involving the use of global variables in UBCSAT, it is NOT
 *  safe to instantiate multiple configurations in succession that use different algorithms of UBCSAT
 *  (i.e. they pass different values to the "-alg" command-line parameter).
 *
 *  If one wants to run multiple different algorithms, these should be instantiated separately
 *  via multiple calls to {@link com.sun.jna.Native#loadLibrary}, passing the
 *  {@link ca.ubc.cs.beta.stationpacking.utils.NativeUtils#NATIVE_OPTIONS} argument each time.
 *
 *  Example: <code>Native.loadLibrary(pathToUBCSATLibrary, UBCSATLibrary.class, NativeUtils.NATIVE_OPTIONS);</code>
