/**
 * Created by newmanne on 1/8/15.
 *
 * The goal is to find stations for which, no matter how their neighbours are arranged, there will always be a channel
 * to put them onto. Then, you can remove them from the problem, and simply add them back afterwards by iterating
 * through their domain until you find a satisfying assignment.
 *
 * One helpful framework for thinking about this problem is to think of the question as:
 * If all of my neighbours were placed adversarially to block out the maximum number of channels from my domain,
 * how many could they block out? If the answer is less than my domain's size, then I am underconstrained.
 *
 * For example,
 * Neighbour A can block out {1, 2} or {2, 3}
 * Neighbour B can block out {2} or {2, 3}
 * Then the worst case is when neighbour A blocks out {1,2} and neighbour B blocks out {2,3}
 *
 * Slightly more formally:
 * There are N groups of sets
 * You have to choose exactly one set from each group
 * Your goal is to maximize the size of the union of the groups that you choose
 * (Note that we don't need the actual values of the choices, just the size)
 *
 * This problem seems to be a variant of the Maximum Coverage Problem
 *
 * We do not solve the problem exactly, but rely instead take the minimum of two heuristics that are upper bounds to this question
 * 1) The size of the union of all the sets in every group
 * 2) The sum of the sizes of the largest set in every group
