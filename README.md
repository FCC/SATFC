# Feasibility Checker

## Release Notes

Rough information about the evolution of **SATFC** through releases.

### SATFC 1.3 [30/10/2014]

* First official release of **SATFC** by the FCC.

### SATFC 1.5 [26/03/2015]

* New feature, _containment cache_, that uses previously solved problems to solve new, related problems. Our experiments with this feature show that it provides significant performance increase, not only by taking care of problems that are seen often (e.g. from very similar auction runs), but also improving solving time of new, unseen problems. This cache is implemented as a standalone server, the **SATFCserver**, to allow multiple **SATFC** solvers to use the same cache and reduce memory overhead. This server in turn uses **redis** as its backbone cache data structure.

### SATFC 1.6 [19/05/2015]

* Upgrade from **clasp** version from 2 to 3, along with new better performing configurations.
* The **SATFCserver** now has a clever clean up procedures to prune away unnecessary entries if the cache becomes too big.
* The cache is now updated on the fly. This means instances solved are immediately accessible to future cache queries (improving performance), and the cache server does not need to be restarted to have access to new data (improving usability). 

### SATFC 1.7 [8/06/2015]

* New feature, _parallel portfolios_, allow SATFC to execute multiple solving techniques in parallel, returning a result as soon as any technique succeeds. Previous versions of SATFC applied each technique sequentially.

## Introduction

**SATFC** (_SAT-based Feasibility Checker_) solves radio-spectrum repacking feasibility problems arising in the reverse auction of the FCC's upcoming broadcast incentive auction. It combines a formulation of feasibility checking based on propositional satisfiability with a heuristic pre-solver and a SAT solver tuned for the types of instances observed in auction simulations.
authors & collaborators SATFC is the product of the ideas and hard work of Auctionomics, notably Alexandre Fréchette, Neil Newman, Paul Cernek, Emily Chenn, Guillaume Saulnier-Comte, Nick Arnosti, and Kevin Leyton-Brown.
