### Swagger SpringMVC Quickstart

A sample project demonstrating how to use Swagger and SpringMVC together.

Please note that this version uses ***NO*** XML configuration, only annotations.

#### Testing
Once deployed, visit [ http://localhost:8080/swagger-springmvc-quickstart/]( http://localhost:8080/swagger-springmvc-quickstart/) to see Swagger in action.  If you run Tomcat (or Jetty or whatever app server you choose) on a different port, make sure you modify `swagger.properties` to point to the new location.
